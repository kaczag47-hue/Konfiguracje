# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

High-level overview of the entire system architecture.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Domain-Driven Design** - Business logic organized by domains
2. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Domains communicate via events
3. **API-First** - Well-defined contracts (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI)
4. **Cloud-Native** - Designed for cloud deployment
5. **Observability** - Built-in monitoring and tracing

## Technology Stack

- **API Gateway** - Entry point for all external requests
- **Event Bus** - Domain event communication
- **Services** - Microservices per subdomain
- **Data Stores** - Domain-specific databases
- **Monitoring** - Centralized logging and metrics

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous
- REST APIs (OpenAPI specs)
- GraphQL (where applicable)

### Asynchronous
- Event-driven (AsyncAPI/Event Schema)
- Message queues
